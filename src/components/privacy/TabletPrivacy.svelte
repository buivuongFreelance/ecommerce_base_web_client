	<p>
		This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected,
		used and shared when you visit or perform a transaction from
		<b> dingtoi.com (the “Site”)</b>
		or when using the
		<b>Dingtoi Scanner App (the “App”)</b>.
		<b>“Dingtoi Lite”</b>
		and
		<b>“Dingtoi Pro”</b>
		are free and premium versions, respectively, of the App.
	</p>
	<p>
		The
		<b>“marketplace”</b>
		refers to Site’s online buy, sell and trade platform for used smartphone shoppers
		and sellers.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Dingtoi Lite Scanner App can be downloaded on Google Play and Apple App
		Store. The Dingtoi Pro Scanner App will be available in late August 2020.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>“Dingtoi Rating”</b>
		is the rating given by our Dingtoi Scanner App after performing a diagnostic
		scan on a phone. The diagnostic scan generates a
		<b>“Summary Report”</b>
		on the App.

	<p>
		We use the Order Information that we collect to fulfill any transactions
		(sales and/or purchases) placed through the Site (including processing your
		payment information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with invoices
		and/or order confirmations). In addition, we use this Order Information to:

		fraud; (iii) and when in line with the preferences you have shared with us,
		provide you with information or advertising relating to our products or
		services.
	</p>
	<p>
		We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for
		potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more
		generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating
		analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to
		assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
	</p>
	<p>
		We also collect information on transactions performed on the Site (including
		brands of phones sold or posted, selling prices of phones, Dingtoi Ratings
		and Scan Reports of phones) in order to help guide buyers and sellers on a
		fair marketplace value for used smartphones.

		surveys (from the Site or from the App) will be used to optimize the
		services provided on the site and to improve our App.
	</p>

		to check against blacklisted, stolen and iCloud locked registries, with the goal
		to ensure that the scanned phone is not stolen. Your Order Information will never
		be shared with third parties, unless for reasons stated within this Policy.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with
		applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or
		other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our
		rights.
