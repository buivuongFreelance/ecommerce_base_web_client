To decide what you want to back up, go to Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud — or go to Settings > iCloud in some older versions of iOS — and toggle on the items you’d like to back up. We recommend you choose to back up almost everything, but especially your Photos, Mail, Contacts, and Notes because the factory reset will wipe the lot.","FRIOS1_2":"Once you have toggled your picks on, scroll down and tap on iCloud Backup then toggle it On (if it isn’t already) and tap Back Up Now. Bear in mind that you’ll need to be connected to Wi-Fi and that it may take a while to complete the backup.","FRIOS1_3":"For more detailed instructions, check out our guide on how to use iCloud to back up your iPhone.","FRIOS1_4":"Alternatively, you can use your PC or laptop. Connect your iPhone to your computer via USB and click the gray Back Up Now button when viewing the Summary tab for your given device in iTunes. If you have a Mac running Catalina, look in Finder under the Devices or Locations tab.","FRIOS2":"Access the Reset menu","FRIOS2_1":"Tap the main Settings icon when viewing the home screen, select General from the resulting menu, and tap the Reset button at the bottom of the page.","FRIOS3":"Reset your iPhone","FRIOS3_1":"Tap the blue Erase All Content and Settings option near the top. If you haven’t backed up as we suggested, then you’ll be prompted to do so. You’ll then be prompted to enter your passcode. Tap the red Erase iPhone option in the resulting pop-up window to confirm your decision.","FRIOS4":"Restore your iPhone","FRIOS4_1":"Once the reset process is complete — a process that may take up to several minutes — check to ensure your phone has been restored to its original factory settings.
